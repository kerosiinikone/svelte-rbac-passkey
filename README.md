### TODO

- Docs
- Make passkey auth work stores other than the current device
- Use new snippets or components to represent anything that is repeated (passcode fields, items)
- Seed the db (write a script) with items
- Toastify
- Fix auth btn
- Errors on passkeys -> passkey deleted, does not exist, etc
- Somehow get the identifier (icloud keychain, microsoft hello) for each passkey to display
- Better UI elements, animations, spinners, skeletons, etc (last in order)
